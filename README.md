# Current Location Version 1.0

It will "Show and Speak" an exact address based on User's location.

## What is it?

With User's permission for sharing location and speaker, this App will show and even speak the full address of the User's location in real time. Apart from the exact address, this App will show some really interesting facts about the country based on User's location.

## Why to use it?

Imagine you are at a very beautiful place and you want to know its exact address, like its street number, House number,Community, Pin code, etc. This App will do that job for you. It's a pretty cool thing for someone who is visiting a country from outside, or someone like me who loves to explore new places, and want to know the exact address - to either revisit that place or want to share that address with friends and family. Imagine how handy it would be if, you have an "Exact Address" of a place you are going to visit.
